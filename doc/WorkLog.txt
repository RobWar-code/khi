    Check existence of ST, ET, VLYS
        Check the rightAngle word in addEndLetter

    Do the gotWin scenario
    
    Check player change colours against computer word

    Change colours for computer should only mark-out crossed words in the word direction

    Clear the console logging from computer.js and board.js

    Clear the last move highlighting from the computer tiles

    Do not select empty rack positions

    Test change letters when not enough tiles left

    Where the computer hiScore is equal, consider random selection

    Introduce score penalty for change tiles

    Remove the playTurn rack test set-up

    Possibly change board back-ground to light grey

    Analyse use of test data for the board and the play 
    
    * Deal with gotWin in end letters etc.

    Reduce the size of the board letters so that the background margins are larger

    When the user's rack tile on the board is clicked, make it the current rack tile

    Consider a computer thinking display

    Sort-out GitHub 2FA registration

    Consider: At the game start allow the user to select board side and start first

    * Build the letter combination flag lists

    Document layer / level object in the code

    Consider working through all the positions to find the best gotWin scenario.

        Set the layer to null initially
        * Do add letters to end
            * Change checkSet currentSelection flag to use null instead of -1 to indicate not set.
            * When setting the checkSet currentSelection flag for a layer, use -(layer + 1)
            * Change the score function to look for currentSelection != null
            * Modify end of levels to take account of layer
            * Retest the end letters procedures
            Test a rack combination with *
        * Write the code for add letters to start
            * Review the start letters code 
            * Test the start letters code
            * need both level and layer data in the checkset for scores - origination of checkSet for addEndLetters
        * Do the rightangle words
            * Check the first rightAngle combination to the rightAngle       

    * Check all computer rack letters replaced

    At the end of each turn set and display the player scores

    At the start of each game re-initialise the game variables and score display

    Allow for computer game finished after change tiles on first word
