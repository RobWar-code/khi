    Consider a computer thinking display

    Clear the console logging from computer.js and board.js

    Possibly change board back-ground to light grey

    Analyse use of test data for the board and the play 
    
    Deal with gotWin in end letters etc.

    Reduce the size of the board letters so that the background margins are larger

    When the user's rack tile on the board is clicked, make it the current rack tile

    Sort-out GitHub 2FA registration

    Consider: At the game start allow the user to select board side and start first

    * Build the letter combination flag lists

    Document layer / level object in the code

    Consider working through all the positions to find the best gotWin scenario.

        Set the layer to null initially
        * Do add letters to end
            * Change checkSet currentSelection flag to use null instead of -1 to indicate not set.
            * When setting the checkSet currentSelection flag for a layer, use -(layer + 1)
            * Change the score function to look for currentSelection != null
            * Modify end of levels to take account of layer
