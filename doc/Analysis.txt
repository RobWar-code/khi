<h1>Introduction and Game Play
    Khi is a board-based crossword game for two players (computer and human).
    With crosswords formed on a board of 19 x 19 squares.

    The aim of the game is for the two players to begin their crosswords
    on opposite sides of the board and to attempt to reach the opposite
    side before their opponent (or the tile hold is emptied for a draw). 
    Game points are achieved by attaining this goal with the minimum possible 
    number of letter tiles.

    Letter tiles are dealt to each player, with the number of tiles being
    maintained at 7 as words are played to the board so long as enough
    tiles remain in the tile hold. The player has blue letter tiles and the 
    computer black. There are 120 tiles in the tile hold at the start.

    The start square at the centre of the opposite (horizontal) sides is
    marked with a star to represent the starting points for each player.
    The computer begins on the right, the player on the left.

    A player must join new words to a letter of his own colour on the 
    board. When a player's new word crosses or forms a new word with tile(s)
    of the opponent's colours, the colours of the words formed or crossed
    are changed to that of the player.

    If a player cannot form a word he can pass. He may also change all
    of his letters for a penalty of 10 points.
