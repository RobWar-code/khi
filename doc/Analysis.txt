<h1>Introduction and Game Play
    Khi is a board-based crossword game for two players (computer and human).
    With crosswords formed on a board of 19 x 19 squares.

    The aim of the game is for the two players to begin their crosswords
    on opposite sides of the board and to attempt to reach the opposite
    side before their opponent (or the tile hold is emptied for a draw). 
    Game points are achieved by capturing as many of the opponents tiles
    as possible.

    Letter tiles are dealt to each player, with the number of tiles being
    maintained at 7 as words are played to the board so long as enough
    tiles remain in the tile hold. The player has blue letter tiles and the 
    computer black. There are 120 tiles in the tile hold at the start.

    The start square at the centre of the opposite (horizontal) sides is
    marked with a star to represent the starting points for each player.
    The computer begins on the right, the player on the left.

    A player must join new words to a letter of his own colour on the 
    board. When a player's new word crosses or forms a new word with tile(s)
    of the opponent's colours, the colours of the words formed or crossed
    are changed to that of the player.

    If a player cannot form a word he can pass. He may also change all
    of his letters for a penalty of 10 points.

<h1>Technology
    HTML, CSS, Javascript, npm word-list

    Single HTML file for presentation.

<h1>Screen Layout
    When the game is first loaded a floating description of the
    game is displayed over the main board area, this has a 
    dismiss button to clear it.

    The main board display has a game title, 19 x 19 cell board,
    7 letter tile rack Play Word, Pass and Change Tiles buttons.
    A menu button with Game Scores.

    The game scores are displayed on a floating div and consists
    of two lists, player and computer.

<h1>Logic Flow
    When the page is loaded, the game initialisation procedures are
    run. These consist of:
        Load Word List 
        Draw Board
        Start Game
            The tile hold is filled
            The players' racks are filled from the tile hold.
            The player's tiles are displayed in the tile rack.
            The player has first turn. 
            The status bar prompts the player to make his move.

    When the page is first loaded the introduction panel is displayed.
    This is cleared when the user clicks its Dismiss button.
    Other buttons are disabled until this is done.

<h1>Tile Play Actions
    When a user clicks a rack tile:
        If another tile is already flagged, then cancel that flag
        and clear the highlight.
        Set the rack tile flag to the number of the clicked tile
        Highlight the clicked tile. 

    When the user clicks a square on the board:
        If no rack tile is current:
            If the square contains a temporary rack tile:
                Return it to the rack
            Otherwise:
                Ignore the click
        Otherwise:
            If the square contains any other tile:
                Ignore the click
            Otherwise:
                Record the tile positioned in the rackTilesSet data
                Set the square to contain the current rack tile
                Clear the highlight from the rack
                Put an empty cell in the rack

<h1>Play Word Actions
    When the Play Word option is used the letters placed - rack.lettersPlaced[0] array
    is checked.
    If no letters have been placed:
        Ignore the option
    Sort the letters placed array by x or y coordinate as the first two tiles
    have been layed.
    Scan the board along the line of the word from lowest to highest
    If there is an empty break in the word or the letters do not form an orthogonal:
        Inform the user and exit
    Count any non-temp letters in the scanned word.
    Count the non-temp own colour letters.
    Scan for connections adjoining each layed letter.
    Count the non-temp own colour letters of adjoining words.
    If the non-temp own colour count is zero:
        Inform the user and exit.
    Check the dictionary to see if the main scanned word exists
    If the main word does not exist:
        Inform the user and exit.
    Scan the adjoining intersections for words
    Record all word start and end cells
    Record the words that do not exist in the dictionary
    If any words do not appear in the dictionary:
        List and inform the user
        Exit.
    Scan all words crossed by the main word, record start
    and end positions

    Clear the temp flag for each letter layed from the board
    data.
    Clear the background highlight from each letter laid
    Change the background color of each newly created and

<h1>Computer Play

<h2>Computer Turn
    Set pass count = 0
    Set change count = 0
    Loop until a scoring word is found or the computer
    passes or the letter change count is reached
        If first word
            If there are no vowels
                Change the letters
                Increment the change letters count
            Else
                Initialise word scores
                do the first word selection
                If no word found
                    Change the letters
                    Increment the change letters count
                Else
                    Set the word found flag
        Else
            Check whether there are any tiles in the rack
            Else
                Initialise word scores
                ...Do board scan etc.
                Decide on pass/change letters
    End Loop
    If the change letters count > max
        Send a message to the display
        Restart the game
    Else if the pass flag 
        Send a message to the display
        Increment the pass count
        Move to next turn
    Else
        Play the computer word to the board
        Check for winning move
        If not Winning Move
            Replenish the computer rack
            If there are no tiles left and the player has no tiles
                Message to the display


<h2>Computer Word Selection 

    In general computer word attempts are scored by the
    following:
        1) Number of opponent's tiles captured
        2) Proximity to winning edge (furthest left)
        3) Tally of letter scores, so that rare letters are used first

<h2>Test Setup

    Testing of the computer logic should be set-up using HTML
    cover scripts in the root directory, ie:
        testOps1.html 
        testOps2.html

<h2>First Word
    The first word composed by the computer ends on the
    starred square on the right hand side of the board.
    It is generally the longest word that can be formed
    from the left by playing the combination of letters.

    First check to see if there are any vowels in the
    set of letters "aeiouy*"

    If there are no vowels: 
        change the letters.
        start again
    
    Create a letter list of the rack tiles
    For each letter in the sorted list:
        If the letter is not the same as the last:
            Use this letter as the first letter
            Select the second letter from the other letters
            missing-out star chars if the first is a star

    Using the selected pair
    If the first is a star do the following for each letter
    of the alphabet, otherwise, use the pair.
        Search the two letter index for the pair
        If there is an entry for the pair:
            If the pair is a word, push the word onto the candidate stack
            and score it (addWordToCandidates())
            Make the three letter combinations from
            this pair and those remaining in the rack
            For each three letter combination
                Search the three letter index for the combination
                If the combination exists
                    If the set of three is a word - addWordToCandidates()
                    Make the four letter combinations from this
                    set of three
                    For each four letter combination
                        Search the four letter index
                        IF there are entries
                            If the four letter word exists - addWordToCandidates()
                            for each of the word list words with this combination
                                Check if the word is 7 or less letters
                                Check whether the remaining letters appear in the rack
                                Consume star letters when not
                                If word matched - addWordToCandidates
                    Next four letter combination allow for *
                else
                    Move to the next three letter combination (allow for *)
        else 
            Move to the next pair (allow for *)

    The levels of indexing can be handled by a recursive function

<h2>Nonfirst Words
    The general aim is search upto five own-tile locations for
    the best computer word score.

<h1>Board Test Setup

    The board test setup is provided to enable the testing of
    computer play with different crossword configurations.

    The use of the board test data is established from index.html
    when the game is loaded.

    The board test data and routines are contained in the file
    src/boardTest.js.

    The routine responsible for loading the board test data and
    displaying it is boardTest.init()

    Data for the board is set out in an array of arrays of rows as 
    follows:

    testBoards [
        [
            "L0|  |  |  |  |A1 ..",
            ..
        ],
    ]

    Letters on the board are followed by the player number with a 
    dividing | with empty cells having two spaces.

    The board test data is scanned to make entries in board.boardData
    table data. Letters are withdrawn from the tileset (allowing for stars)
    as they are placed in the board data.

    The game turn number is given by the programmer with the data.

    It is assumed that the next turn is the user's turn, with the
    computer play occurring subsequently.

<h1>Word List and Word Indexing

    The word list used is that supplied from npm. This is
    a lowercase list of English words that excludes single
    letter words.

    Three indexes are built from the word list, using the
    initial 2, 3 and 4 characters of each word of the 
    word list. The lengths of these indexes are 26 ^ n
    items and allow for the calculation of the keyed
    index offset. Word list pointers in the indexes are 
    either null or point to the array offset of the
    start of the matched set.

    A general purpose word search is supplied which
    checks the length of the word to decide which
    index to use.

    Note that it may be better to supply the indexes
    pre-built.
